## Week 1: Introduction

> “Governments differ in kind, as will be evident to anyone who considers the matter according to the method that has guided us so far. As in other departments of science, so in politics, the compound should always be disaggregated into the simplest elements, or essential parts, of the whole. We must therefore look at the elements of which the state is composed, in order to see how the different kinds of rule differ from one another and whether any scientific result can be attained about each one of them.” 
> 
> \-- Aristotle, *The Politics*, Book 1, Chapter 1
