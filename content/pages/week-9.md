## Modernization and Development 

- What is the effect of “modernization” or “development” on politics?
- Lipset is generally remembered for the argument that economic development leads to democracy. Is that his actual claim about the effect of modernization on politics?
- What is Dahl’s view of the political impact of modernization, and how does it differ from Lipset’s? What about Huntington? Who is right?
- Cornelius uses a very different method from the others. Does it reveal anything that the other authors’ accounts do not?
