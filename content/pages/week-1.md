## Introduction

- In a famous piece, Przeworski and Teune (1970) argue for “turning proper names into variables” when making comparisons across countries (a recommendation which would seem to echo Aristotle’s advice). Give an example of how you might follow their advice. Do you like the result?
- Many years ago, most political scientists (including area specialists) failed to predict the collapse of the Soviet Union. Some scholars have argued that this failure was not fundamentally problematic for political science, because the USSR was “just one data point.” As far as you are concerned, is this a satisfying response? If not, is there a better one?
- How do you think political science research is supposed to be conducted? Is it actually conducted this way? If not, why not? How does research in our discipline compare to the way research is actually conducted in other fields?
- What role do you think political scientists should play in the world? Are there any roles they should not play? What role do you hope to play?
- Four island nations are settled differently:
    - In *Ekahi*, a number of families settle a previously uninhabited territory as a group.
    - In *Elua*, groups of families, each under the command of different chiefs (one of whom is also paramount chief) settle a previously uninhabited territory.
    - In *Ekolu,* a number of families travel to a new territory as a group, and upon arrival encounter a large number of technologically less advanced indigenes.
    - In *Eha*, male warriors under the command of a single chief or war leader encounter a large number of technologically less advanced indigenes. 
    - Visiting them 50 years later, what sort of political institutions would you expect to find in each?
